 /*Write a Java class named Holiday. The class should have four fields, name of type String, day of
   type int, month of type String, and year of type int. The class should have get and set methods
   for each field. The class should have a toString() method that displays the value of each field.
   The class should have a constructor which sets the value of each field. The constructor should
   verify that the value of the parameter corresponding to the month field contains a valid value
   before assigning the value to the month field. If not, then the constructor should set the value
   to ”ERROR”. The constructor should verify that the value of the parameter corresponding to
   the day field is valid. If not, then the constructor should set the value to -1.
   Write another class called TestHoliday that creates four Holiday objects, three with invalid
   values and one with valid values. Finally, print the objects to the screen*/
